# GitHubPagesSetup

This project allows you to quickly create your GitHub pages. Here's what you do:
1. Just create a repo with the name YOUR-USERNAME.github.io in your GitHub account. (e.g. danielmeixner.github.io in my case).
2. Then open the repo in a Codespace.
3. You're done. Everything will be done in the background for you. A few minutes later you can find your GitHub page in http://your-user-name.github.io
